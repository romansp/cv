# Raman Paulau

Hi! My name is Raman.

I'm software developer with focus in web applications written in JavaScript and C#. I absolutely love Vue.js, TypeScript, and passionate about performance.

Outside of programming, I enjoy going to concerts and seeing films at movie theatres.

You can find my open source work on my [GitHub](https://github.com/romansp) profile or follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rpvlv).
