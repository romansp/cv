# Raman Paulau

Hi! My name is Raman.

I'm software developer with focus in web applications written in JavaScript and C#. I absolutely love Vue.js, TypeScript, and passionate about performance. Sometimes I write [blog posts](/blog).

Outside of programming, I enjoy going to concerts and seeing movies at my favorite theater.

You can find my open source work on [GitHub](https://github.com/romansp). And you can also follow me on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/paulau.dev) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rpvlv).
